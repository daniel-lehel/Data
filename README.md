# Taxi Trips Data Processing Project

## Overview
This project is an **educational data engineering study** aimed at processing and enriching datasets sourced from the **Chicago Data Portal**. It focuses on taxi trips data, integrating **weather information** to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis.

## Objectives
- **Extract and process taxi trips data** from the Chicago Data Portal.
- **Integrate weather data** to enhance insights and provide additional context.
- Demonstrate data engineering techniques and best practices.

## Features
- Automated data extraction and transformation processes.
- Data enrichment with external weather datasets.
- Clean and structured output tables suitable for analytical tasks.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for scripting and data processing.
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data manipulation.
- **APIs** to fetch weather data.
- **AWS S3** or local storage for managing datasets (optional).

## Data Sources
1. **Chicago Data Portal**: Taxi trip records including timestamps, trip distance, fare amounts, and more.
2. **Weather API or Dataset**: Historical weather data to complement taxi trip records.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
